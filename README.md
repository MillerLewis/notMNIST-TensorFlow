# notMNIST-TensorFlow

Written in Python 3

The following files will be my attempt at using TensorFlow on the notMNIST dataset for classification.
I will be attempting to use a ConvNet with varying regularization techniques (e.g. dropout, smallish max weights)

The downloading and extracting of the files itself has been my attempt + solutions at the following: https://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning/deep-learning/tensorflow/notmnist/
I'm going to take a different approach at normalizing the data though. The attempt by Ritchie Ng was quick and simple, but I'd like to test myself and make sure that I can do it with near 100% accuracy.

Other than tensorflow, numpy and matplotlib will be used.
